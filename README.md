The disassembly was done using ReSource V6.06 in WinUAE.

using [Maptapper](https://codetapper.com/amiga/maptapper/).

Further editing and testing was done using
[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the
[Amiga Assembly](https://github.com/prb28/vscode-amiga-assembly)
extension.
